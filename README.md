# pixelperfect

As a developer on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file. In this assignment, you'll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website.

Choose one of the sites below and create a html document using html and css to be a "pixel perfect" match with the image, but be a functioning website.
For Surf and Paddel, use these fonts from Google Web Fonts in your implementation -- "Open Sans" for most copy, "Oswald" for headings
Use the FontAwesome icons for all icon elements
Use placeholder text of your choice for all copy (not headings)
Use placeholder images of your choosing
